# Assignmet
NLP assignment 

The following code is the assignment solution.

The given assignment is based on text classification so we are using Universal Sentence Encode as it encodes text into high dimensional vectors that can be used for this task and it also capture meaning of sentences using sentence embeddings. We are using pre-trained model here and fine tuning it on our own dataset. As we are not trainig it from scratch hence it will take less time in training.


Requirements:
tensorflow
pandas
sklearn
numpy

dataset:
we are using the dataset that was given in the assignment.

To run a code:
put dataset file in the same folder as the code then in terminal type the below command:
python text_classification.py
